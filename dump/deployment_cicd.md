**Prerequisites:**
1. A Django project hosted on GitHub.
2. A DigitalOcean droplet set up with the necessary server configurations.

**Step 1: Set Up a DigitalOcean Droplet**
- Ensure your DigitalOcean droplet is properly configured with the necessary dependencies, such as a web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) and a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL). Make sure your Django project is uploaded to the droplet.

**Step 2: Install Required Tools on Your DigitalOcean Droplet**
- SSH into your DigitalOcean droplet.
- Install any necessary tools like Docker, Docker Compose, and Git to facilitate the deployment process.

**Step 3: Create a Deployment Script**
- In your Django project directory on the DigitalOcean droplet, create a deployment script. This script will pull the latest code from your GitHub repository and restart the application.
- You can use a Bash script or Python script depending on your preference.

**Step 4: Configure GitHub Actions**
- Go to your GitHub repository and click on the "Actions" tab.
- Create a new workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) in your repository. This file will define your CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions.

Here's an example of a basic `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Django Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.8

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
        working-directory: ./your_django_project_directory

      - name: Deploy to DigitalOcean
        run: |
          ssh your_droplet_user@your_droplet_ip 'bash /path/to/deployment/script.sh'
        env:
          DO_DROPLET_IP: ${{ secrets.DO_DROPLET_IP }}
          DO_DROPLET_USER: ${{ secrets.DO_DROPLET_USER }}
          SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        working-directory: ./your_django_project_directory
```

**Step 5: Set GitHub Secrets**
- In your GitHub repository, go to "Settings" > "Secrets".
- Create the following secrets:
  - `DO_DROPLET_IP`: Your DigitalOcean droplet's IP address.
  - `DO_DROPLET_USER`: The username to access your droplet.
  - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your SSH private key.

**Step 6: Push Changes to GitHub**
- Commit the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file to your GitHub repository.
- When you push changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will trigger the deployment workflow.

**Step 7: Monitor and Troubleshoot**
- Monitor the workflow execution on GitHub Actions for any errors.
- Check the deployment script on your DigitalOcean droplet for any issues.

By following these steps, your Django project should now automatically deploy to your DigitalOcean droplet whenever you push changes to GitHub. This streamlined CI/CD process will help you as a professional Django developer to save time and ensure consistent deployments. Make sure to adjust the configuration to match your specific project and server setup.

Encourage browser caching: Simple solutions include setting an appropriate Expires header, Last-Modified date or adopting ETags in the HTTP header.

Use a Content Delivery Network: consider dedicated image hosting.

Remove unused assets: use tools such as Chromeâ€™s Audit Developer Tool, JSLint, Dust-Me Selectors, CSS Usage, unused-css.com or build tools such as grunt-uncss.
